# How to sort the pivot grid's data by OLAP member properties


This example demonstrates how to sort data by OLAP member properties using the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraPivotGridPivotGridControl_CustomServerModeSorttopic">CustomServerModeSort</a> event. In this example, the "Product" field's values are sorted by the "List Price" OLAP member property.  The "List Price" member property values are displayed near the Products field values.<br />
<p>Note that this sample demonstrates how to sort data manually using the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraPivotGridPivotGridControl_CustomServerModeSorttopic">CustomServerModeSort</a> event. If you want to sort data by an attribute value, use the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#CoreLibraries/DevExpressXtraPivotGridPivotGridFieldBase_SortByAttributetopic">PivotGridFieldBase.SortByAttribute</a> property instead.</p>
